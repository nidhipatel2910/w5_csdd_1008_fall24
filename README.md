# Simple CRUD API with Go
This project is a RESTful API built using Go's net/http package for managing a collection of tasks. Each task has a title, description, and status (either "pending" or "completed"). The API supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and stores tasks in-memory (no database required).

Features
Create a new task: Add a task with a title and description.
Read tasks:
Get all tasks.
Get a specific task by its ID.
Update a task: Modify the title, description, or status of a task.
Delete a task: Remove a task by its ID.
